# CalHacks 9.0 Building Apps Workshop Demo

To get started:

```shell
cd [REPO_NAME]
yarn install
expo install
expo start
```

Make sure you make a `keys.json` file in the root directory. It'll be auto-created for you when you make a new project and then a web app on Firebase, and it should line up in terms of fields with the `keys.template.json`. The steps are listed on the website as well.

There are 5 sections that correlate with the slide deck:

- #1: JavaScript Review
- #2: React Concepts
- #3: Navigation
- #4: Firebase Auth
- #4: Firebase Firestore

Note that the first section doesn't have any code, but rather examples of interesting operators/functions being used present in the code for your reference.

It is recommended to fill these out in order.

For hints:

- Look at other files! Some of them will contain similar code that you can use as inspiration.
- Read the comments that indicate what you should be doing at each part.

Additinally, while TypeScript is not formally a part of this workshop, you can check out the `models/` directory for some simple examples and there's a lot of type annotations present throughout the entire project already.
